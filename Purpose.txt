ðŸ“Œ Project Purpose: LeetCode Tracker

1. Why This Project?
Many students and professionals practice coding daily but struggle to organize their progress, track solved problems, or review what they've learned. This project solves that problem by acting as a personalized LeetCode problem tracker.

2. What It Does

Lets users log the problems they've solved or want to solve.

Allows filtering problems by status (solved, unsolved, in-progress).

Stores all data securely using MongoDB.

Provides a clean UI to check daily, weekly, or monthly progress.

Uses Redis for performance improvement (e.g., caching sessions or data).

Supports image uploads (if needed) using Cloudinary.

3. Who Is It For?

Students preparing for coding interviews.

Developers who want to build a consistent problem-solving habit.

Anyone who practices on LeetCode and wants to track and reflect on their journey.

4. Final Goal
To provide a full-stack web platform where users can monitor their LeetCode performance, set goals, and stay motivated throughout their coding journey.
